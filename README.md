# Sjasm #

Sjasm is a Z80 assembler originally developed by Sjoerd Mastijn. It is available to download, sources included, at [XL2S Entertainment site](http://home.online.nl/~smastijn/home.html).

This repository has been created from the original sources as a means to have them properly organized and easily browseable (and some cool features have been added to v0.39 along the way). It contains a Visual Studio solution holding a Visual C++ project with the sources themselves, and a C# project containing unit tests.

Two branches are available for the two versions of the program, they have been created from versions 0.39g6 and 0.42c. **Switch to one of these branches to actually see code**.

Download the latest binary of v0.39 for Windows and Linux from [the releases section](https://github.com/Konamiman/Sjasm/releases). The unmodified package for v0.42c is available there as well.

Apart from being included in their repsective packages, the documentation for v0.39 is in [a text file together with the source](https://github.com/Konamiman/Sjasm/blob/v0.39/README.txt) and the manual for v0.42 is available as [a set of HTML files in the repository](https://github.com/Konamiman/Sjasm/tree/v0.42/Manual), but you probably prefer to [see it properly rendered](http://konamiman.bitbucket.org/sjasm-manual).

Enjoy!
